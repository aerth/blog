# Why in the world would I use NetBSD?!

* Simplicity
* Lightweight
* Fast kernel
* Stable as fuck
* Easy to install software via pkgsrc current
* A minimal system

So this page is dedicated to the 10+ years I have used linux.

## For all you GNU/Linux Penguins, try BSD! You can use *most* of the same software that you are familiar with! And your servers will run smoother.
