Hey do you use wordpress!?

Hey do you still use PHP!?

Have you heard of cosgo!?

```

Get cosgo for free at https://github.com/aerth/cosgo

See it in action, contact the author at: https://isupon.us/cosgo

Use custom template, secure your contact form, and serve fast pages all day with **cosgo**!

# The end of PHP

I created cosgo so that I could host multiple web pages on a single server without 
opening up the vulnerabilities of PHP, or apache.

Currently, I have 4 instances running 24/7 on some VMs and haven't ran into any 
issues. Please let me know if you have an awesome theme on your cosgo instance!

File bugs at github

Thanks
